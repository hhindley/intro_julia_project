# Intro to Modelling ODEs in Julia

This repository introduces ODE modelling in Julia through practical examples: a simple Michaelis-Menten model, bacterial growth ([Weiße et al. 2015](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1416533112)), and an RNA system in *E. coli* ([Hindley et al. 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-64759-3)).

## Prerequisites

- [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
- An IDE supporting `.ipynb` and `.jl` files (e.g., [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia))

## Quick Start

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:hhindley/intro_julia_project.git
```

## Tasks

1. **`basic_intro/intro_to_odes.ipynb`** — Start here with a notebook-based introduction to ODEs
2. **`basic_project/`** — Explore project structure with individual Julia files
    - `run_model.jl` — Main file to run code
    - Other files contain reusable components
3. **`model_intros/`** — Build the two complex models
    - `growth_model_intro.ipynb`
    - `rtc_model_intro.ipynb`

## Next Steps

Once you have worked through the examples in this repo, I would suggest [creating your own repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) to start your own projects. Clone this to your local machine, and then you can [add, commit, push and pull](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git#example-contribute-to-an-existing-repository) to your repo to keep your work up to date.
